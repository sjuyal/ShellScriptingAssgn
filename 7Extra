1) Find a way to run this everyday at 12:01 AM or 0001 hrs.

	I will append an entry in crontab with following instruction
	1 0 * * * bash 7.sh

	This will run for 1st min of 00:00 hrs and every day of every month

2) Find a way to run this every monday and generate a log for accesses made on
sundays.

	I will append an entry in crontab with following instruction
	1 0 * * 1 bash 7.sh
	
	This will run for 1st min of 00:00 hrs and every monday of every month. But here if we 		dont want to generate log we can remove '>> AccessLog' from the file 7.sh

	And for sunday accesslog will be generated as it is happening in the script
	1 0 * * 0 bash 7.sh
